# Apigee Remote Service CLI

This is the CLI for Apigee's Remote Service for Envoy. The CLI installs the "remote-service"
proxy into Apigee Runtime and provides certain runtime management functions on the command line.

## Getting Started

Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-remote-service-envoy/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Support

Issues filed on Github are not subject to service level agreements (SLAs) and responses should be
assumed to be on an ad-hoc volunteer basis. The [Apigee community board](https://community.apigee.com/)
is recommended as for community support and is regularly checked by Apigee experts.

Apigee customers should use [formal support channels](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/support).
