# Creates a JWT authentication Policy for httpbin.
# This causes Istio to evaluate JWT tokens passed to httpbin services.
# The `originIsOptional: true` flag will allow requests with missing or invalid JWTs
# to continue in case a valid x-api-key value can be evaluated by Apigee.

# You must update the issuer and jwks_uri for your environment.
# Deprecated as of Istio 1.5 (see request-authentication.yaml)
